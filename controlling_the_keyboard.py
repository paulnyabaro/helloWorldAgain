# text = '''When spring and summer creep up on us, we often don't know if what we're experiencing are allergies or basic end-of-flu-season ailments. There are a number of ways to recognize allergy symptoms and differentiate between being sick and having an allergic reaction. The reason why it's important to know the difference is because allergic reactions can run the gamut from the very mild and up to life-threatening symptoms so you need to know which kind you experience. A few surefire symptoms of allergic reactions are as follows: rashes, itchy eyes, nasal congestion, itchiness, difficulty breathing, cramps, vomiting, and dizziness. In 1912, Titanic is the largest artificial moving object in the world. She is as long as four city blocks and wider than a four-lane highway. Some people say she is unsinkable. No expense has been spared to build her. She is grand in every way. Many wealthy and important people are aboard to experience the one-of-a-kind voyage. Tonight, the water is calm and looks as smooth as glass. Yet, there may be danger. Suddenly, something is seen ahead. It looks dark against the starry sky. It's big and it's close. Iceberg right ahead! Titanic travels ever nearer to the PAGE 2 iceberg. Slowly, the ship begins to swing away. It looks like the ship might miss the iceberg after all. Then comes a grinding sound. Under the water, the iceberg is much wider than it looks. Titanic scrapes against it. The iceberg has slashed holes in the side of one of the furnace rooms. As water gushes through the holes, it nearly sweeps the crewmen off their feet. Within minutes, the cold, swirling seawater is up to their waists. Seawater is also gushing through holes torn into other sections of the ship. Titanic's hull has 16 sections. Doors can seal off each section if they are damaged. The officer on the bridge orders all the doors closed. He hopes this will prevent disaster. He doesn't know that it's already too late. The doors slow, but cannot stop, the water because the walls don't reach the ceiling. As seawater fills each section, the water spills over the wall into the next section. The first five sections soon fill with water. Valuable ores lay hidden beneath Death Valley. These treasures included gold and silver. When miners gave up on the goldfields in other parts of California, many came to the desert. Most mining settlements followed a predictable pattern. First came PAGE 3 the prospectors. They searched for gold deposits. When they made a strike, they staked a claim. Then they either worked the claim themselves or sold it. Miners came to Death Valley for more than gold. Some came to mine a kind of salt. People used the salt to make a substance called borax. It was used to make glass, ceramics, and cleaning products. Splat! What just hit me? Where did it come from? Welcome to the world of paintball! You were just hit (or marked) by a small round colorful object, about 0.68 inches in diameter, called a paintball. This is the size of your basic paintball. A basic paintball is filled with water-soluble dye encapsulated in gelatin and comes in nice bright colors or in eco-friendly basic green. Put this little round colorful ball in a device called a marker and you have the beginnings of an experience you will never forget. The game of paintball! Vegetable gardening requires a lot more work than herb gardening. In fact, vegetable gardening can be one of the most time-consuming types of gardening. Many vegetables require watering and fertilizing at regular intervals, and may require a lot of different types of maintenance. Some vegetables are hardier and less picky than others'''

text = '''Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of gamma rays associated with extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several minutes, although a typical burst lasts between 20 to 40 seconds. The initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived afterglow emitted at extended wavelengths. Most observed GRBs are believed to consist of a narrow beam of intense radiation released during a supernova event as a rapidly-rotating, high-mass star collapses to form a neutron star, quark star, or black hole. Sedimentary rocks are formed at the surface of the Earth, either in water or on land. They are layered accumulations of sediments, fragments of rocks, minerals, or animal or plant material. If a layer of sediment is buried beneath overlying rock, the layer becomes compacted and may form a layer of sedimentary rock. The sediment becomes cemented together by minerals and chemicals or is held together by electrical attraction. Sand and gravel deposits on beaches or in river bars look like the sandstone and conglomerate they may become. Compacted and driedmud flats harden into shale. Mud and shells settling on sea floors can cement into limestone. Sedimentary rocks are important sources of natural resources like coal, fossil fuels, drinking water or ores. Fire is a chemical reaction between fuel and oxygen. Heat is necessary to ignite the reaction. Once a fire has been started, it creates enough heat as a byproduct to keep igniting new fuels. In nature, fuels can be preheated by the sun. This can make them more likely to ignite, either by human error, as with a dropped cigarette or unattended campfire, or by lightning. Fuels themselves are abundant, especially in forests that have not burned in recent years. Oxygen is readily available in the air we breathe. It has about 21% oxygen in it. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. The negative effects include water contamination, soil erosion, atmospheric pollution and hazard to human and animal life. An earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust producing seismic waves. Earthquakes occur most often along geological faults. They are measured using observations from seismometers. Magnitude 3 orlower earthquakes are mostly undetectable and magnitude 7 or greater can cause serious damage over large areas, depending on their depth. The shallower an earthquake, the more damage to structures it causes. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and sometimes displacing the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and volcanic activity. Solar flares often form around sunspots. A solar flare forms when gases and energy explode from the sun's surface. The jet of energy shoots into space. It reaches Earth in just a few days. Colliding with Earth's atmosphere, the energy streams toward Earth's poles. It causes gases in the atmosphere to glow, green, blue, red, and even pink. We call these shimmering colors auroras. Energy from the sun not only warms Earth. It warms all the planets. A planet is a large space object that orbits a star. In all, eight planets orbit the Sun (or nine, for those who count Pluto among them). Four of these planets are small, rocky worlds. They're called the inner planets. The other four are gas giants'''
