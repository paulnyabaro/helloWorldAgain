# SUMMARY
"""The ? matches zero or one of the preceding group.
The * matches zero or more of the preceding group.
The + matches one or more of the preceding group.
The {n} matches exactly n of the preceding group.
The {n,} matches n or more of the preceding group.
The {,m} matches 0 to m of the preceding group.
The {n,m} matches at least n and at most m of the preceding group.
{n,m}? or *? or +? performs a non-greedy match of the preceding group.
^spam means the string must begin with spam.
spam$ means the string must end with spam.
The . matches any character, except newline characters.
\d, \w, and \s match a digit, word, or space character, respectively.
\D, \W, and \S match anything except a digit, word, or space character,
respectively.
[abc] matches any character between the brackets (such as a, b, or c).
[^abc] matches any character that isnâ€™t between the brackets."""
